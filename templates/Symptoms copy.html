Heart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease. <br>
Symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels <br>

Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affects the major blood vessels that supply the heart muscle. Cholesterol deposits (plaques) in the heart arteries are usually the cause of coronary artery disease. The buildup of these plaques is called atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. <br>

Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue. <br> <br>

Symptoms of coronary artery disease can include: <br> <br>

    Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina) <br>
    Shortness of breath <br>
    Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly area or back <br>
    Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if the blood vessels in those body areas are narrowed <br> <br>

You might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for heart symptoms and discuss concerns with your health care provider. Heart (cardiovascular) disease can sometimes be found early with regular health checkups. <br>
What is coronary artery disease? A Mayo Clinic cardiologist explains. <br> <br>

Stephen Kopecky, M.D., talks about the risk factors, symptoms and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Learn how lifestyle changes can lower your risk. <br> 
Heart disease symptoms caused by irregular heartbeats (heart arrhythmias) <br>  <br> 

The heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:
<br>  <br> 

    Chest pain or discomfort <br> 
    Dizziness <br> 
    Fainting (syncope) or near fainting <br> 
    Fluttering in the chest <br> 
    Lightheadedness <br> 
    Racing heartbeat (tachycardia) <br> 
    Shortness of breath <br> 
    Slow heartbeat (bradycardia) <br>  <br> 

Heart disease symptoms caused by congenital heart defects <br> 

Serious congenital heart defects usually are noticed soon after birth. Congenital heart defect symptoms in children could include: <br>  <br> 

    Pale gray or blue skin or lips (cyanosis) <br> 
    Swelling in the legs, belly area or areas around the eyes <br> 
    In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain <br> 

Less-serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include: <br>  <br> 

    Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity <br> 
    Easily tiring during exercise or activity <br> 
    Swelling of the hands, ankles or feet <br>  <br> 

Heart disease symptoms caused by diseased heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) <br>  <br> 

Early stages of cardiomyopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include: <br>  <br> 

    Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting <br> 
    Fatigue <br> 
    Feeling short of breath during activity or at rest <br> 
    Feeling short of breath at night when trying to sleep or waking up short of breath <br> 
    Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering <br> 
    Swollen legs, ankles or feet <br>  <br> 

Heart disease symptoms caused by heart valve problems (valvular heart disease) <br>  <br> 

The heart has four valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves. They open and close to move blood through the heart. Many things can damage the heart valves. A heart valve may become narrowed (stenosis), leaky (regurgitation or insufficiency) or close improperly (prolapse). <br>  <br> 

Valvular heart disease is also called heart valve disease. Depending on which valve isn't working properly, heart valve disease symptoms generally include: <br>  <br> 

    Chest pain <br> 
    Fainting (syncope) <br> 
    Fatigue <br> 
    Irregular heartbeat <br> 
    Shortness of breath <br> 
    Swollen feet or ankles <br>  <br> 

Endocarditis is an infection that affects the heart valves and inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves (endocardium). Endocarditis symptoms can include: <br>  <br> 

    Dry or persistent cough <br> 
    Fever <br> 
    Heartbeat changes <br> 
    Shortness of breath <br> 
    Skin rashes or unusual spots <br> 
    Swelling of the legs or belly area <br> 
    Weakness or fatigue <br>  <br> 

When to see a doctor <br>  <br> 

Seek emergency medical care if you have these heart disease symptoms: <br>  <br> 

    Chest pain <br> 
    Shortness of breath <br> 
    Fainting <br> 

Always call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack. <br>  <br> 

Heart disease is easier to treat when detected early. Talk to your health care provider if you have any concerns about your heart health. Together, you and your provider can discuss ways to reduce your heart disease risk. This is especially important if you have a family history of heart disease. <br>  <br> 

If you think you may symptoms of heart disease, make an appointment to see your provider.Symptoms
