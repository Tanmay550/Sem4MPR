                Heart disease causes depend on the specific type of heart disease. There are many different types of heart disease.
                How the heart works. <br><br>
                
                To understand the causes of heart disease, it may help to understand how the heart works.<br><br>
                
                    The heart is divided into chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).<br>
                    The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through blood vessels (pulmonary arteries).<br>
                    In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins.<br>
                    The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body.<br>
                
                <h3>Heart valves</h3>
                
                Four heart valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid — keep the blood moving the right way. The valves open only one way and only when they need to. Valves must open all the way and close tightly so there's no leakage.
                Heartbeats. <br><br>
                
                A beating heart squeezes (contracts) and relaxes in a continuous cycle.<br><br>
                
                    During contraction (systole), the lower heart chambers (ventricles) squeeze tight. This action forces blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.
                    During relaxation (diastole), the ventricles fill with blood from the upper heart chambers (atria).<br><br>
                
                    <h3>Electrical system</h3>
               
                The heart's electrical system keeps it beating. The heartbeat controls the continuous exchange of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. This exchange keeps you alive.<br><br>
                
                    Electrical signals start in the upper right chamber (right atrium).
                    The signals travel through specialized pathways to the lower heart chambers (ventricles). This tells the heart to pump.<br><br>
                
                <h3>Causes of coronary artery disease</h3>
                
                A buildup of fatty plaques in the arteries (atherosclerosis) is the most common cause of coronary artery disease. Risk factors include a poor diet, lack of exercise, obesity and smoking. Healthy lifestyle choices can help lower the risk of atherosclerosis.
                Causes of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)<br><br>
                
                Common causes of arrhythmias or conditions that can lead to them include:<br><br>
                
                    Cardiomyopathy<br>
                    Coronary artery disease<br>
                    Diabetes<br>
                    Drug misuse<br>
                    Emotional stress<br>
                    Excessive use of alcohol or caffeine<br>
                    Heart problem present at birth (congenital heart defects)<br>
                    High blood pressure<br>
                    Smoking<br>
                    Heart valve disease<br>
                    Use of certain medications, including those bought without a prescription, and herbs and supplements<br><br>
                
                Causes of congenital heart defects<br><br>
                
                A congenital heart defect develops while a baby is growing in the womb. A congenital heart defect forms as the baby's heart develops, about a month after conception. Congenital heart defects change the flow of blood in the heart. Some medical conditions, medications and genes increase the risk of congenital heart defects.<br><br>
