            <div class="content">
                Certain foods, including leafy greens, whole grains, and fatty fish, can benefit your heart health and lower your risk of heart disease. <br>

                Diet plays a major role in heart health and can impact your risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death for adults in the US (1Trusted Source).<br>
                
                The food you eat can influence heart disease risk factors, including:<br>
                
                    blood pressure<br>
                    triglycerides<br>
                    cholesterol levels<br>
                    inflammation<br><br>
                
                
                1. Leafy green vegetables<br><br>
                
                Leafy green vegetables like spinach, kale, and collard greens are well known for their wealth of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.<br>
                
                In particular, they’re a great source of vitamin K, which helps protect your arteries and promote proper blood clotting (2Trusted Source).<br>
                
                They’re also high in dietary nitrates, which have been shown to reduce blood pressure, decrease arterial stiffness, and improve the function of cells lining the blood vessels (3).
                <br>
                The American Heart Association (AHA) notes that an increased leafy green vegetable intake was associated with more significant benefits to cardiovascular health and a lower risk of heart disease than other fruits and vegetables (4Trusted Source).<br>
                
                    Summary<br><br>
                
                    Leafy green vegetables are high in vitamin K and nitrates, which can help reduce blood pressure and improve arterial function. A higher intake of leafy greens is associated with a lower risk of heart disease.<br><br>
                
                2. Whole grains<br>
                
                Whole grains include all three nutrient-rich parts of the grain:<br>
                
                    germ<br>
                    endosperm<br>
                    bran<br>
                
                Common types of whole grains include:<br>
                
                    whole wheat<br>
                    brown rice<br>
                    oats<br>
                    rye<br>
                    barley<br>
                    buckwheat<br>
                    quinoa<br>
                
                Refined carbohydrates increase the risk of coronary heart disease. But whole grains are protective. An extra 1 or 2 daily servings of these foods increases or decreases risk by approximately 10-20% (5Trusted Source).<br>
                
                Multiple studies have found that eating more whole grains can benefit your heart health.<br>
                
                The AHA recommends eating whole grains rather than refined grains daily can reduce your risk for (6Trusted Source):<br>
                
                    cardiovascular disease<br>
                    coronary heart disease<br>
                    stroke<br>
                    metabolic syndrome<br>
                
                Adopting a diet rich in plant-based foods, whole grains, low fat dairy products, and sodium intake within recommended limits can help prevent and manage hypertension (7Trusted Source).<br>
                
                When purchasing whole grains, make sure to read the ingredients label carefully. Phrases like “whole grain” or “100% whole wheat” indicate a whole grain product, while words like “wheat flour” or “multigrain” may not.<br>
                
                    Summary<br>
                
                    Eating whole grains is associated with lower cholesterol and systolic blood pressure, as well as a lower risk of heart disease.<br><br>
                
                3. Berries
                <br>
                Strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries are jam-packed with nutrients that play a central role in heart health.<br>
                
                Berries are also rich in antioxidants like anthocyanins, which protect against oxidative stress and inflammation that can contribute to the development of heart disease. Higher anthocyanin intake may raise your risk of coronary artery disease, including heart attack and hypertension (8Trusted Source).<br>
                
                Eating blueberries daily may also improve the function of cells that line the blood vessels (vascular function), which help control blood pressure and blood clotting (8Trusted Source).<br>
                
                According to a review of research, berry consumption may be an effective intervention for metabolic syndrome by helping reduce oxidative stress and inflammation while improving vascular function (9Trusted Source).<br>
                
                Berries can be a satisfying snack or a delicious dessert. Try adding a few different types to your diet to take advantage of their health benefits.<br>
                
                    Summary<br>
                
                    Berries are rich in antioxidants. Eating them can reduce multiple risk factors for heart disease.<br><br>
                
                4. Avocados
                <br>
                Avocados are an excellent source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, which have been linked to reduced cholesterol levels and a lower risk of heart disease. Eating at least two servings of avocado each week was linked to a 16% reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and a 21% reduced risk of coronary heart disease (10Trusted Source).<br>
                
                A comprehensive review of studies determined that avocado may help improve (11Trusted Source):<br>
                
                    LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, including levels of small, dense LDL cholesterol<br>
                    triglyceride levels<br>
                    vascular function<br>
                
                Avocados are also rich in potassium, a nutrient essential to heart health, and can help reduce blood pressure. One serving of avocado (150 grams) supplies 725 milligrams of potassium, or about 21% of the amount you need daily, based on the adult male daily adequate intake (12Trusted Source).<br>
                
                    Summary  <br>
                
                    Avocados are high in monounsaturated fats and potassium. They may help lower your cholesterol, blood pressure, and risk of metabolic syndrome.<br><br>
                
                5. Fatty fish and fish oil<br>
                
                Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, sardines, and tuna are loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, which have been studied extensively for their heart-health benefits.
                <br>
                Omega-3 fatty acids from fatty fish may have a protective role in the risk of developing heart disease and slightly reduce the risk of CVD events and arrhythmias (13Trusted Source).<br>
                
                Eating fish over the long term may support lower levels of (14Trusted Source):
                <br>
                    total cholesterol<br>
                    blood triglycerides<br>
                    fasting blood sugar<br>
                    systolic blood pressure<br>
                
                Fish consumption is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, and mortality (15Trusted Source).<br>
                
                If you don’t eat much seafood, fish oil is another option for getting your daily dose of omega-3 fatty acids.<br>
                
                Fish oil supplements may reduce rates of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, sudden death, and stroke (16Trusted Source).<br>
                
                Other omega-3 supplements like krill oil or algal oil are popular alternatives.
                <br><br>
                    Summary<br>
                
                    Fatty fish and fish oil are both high in omega-3 fatty acids and may help reduce heart disease risk factors, including blood pressure, triglycerides, and cholesterol.<br>
